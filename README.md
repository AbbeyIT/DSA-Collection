## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository follows a simple two-level structure:

```
DSA-Collection/
├── LanguageName/     # Your chosen programming language
    └── TopicName/    # Your chosen topic or category
         └── your_solution.ext  # Your implementation
```

For example:
```
Python/
├── trees/
│   └── binary_tree_traversal.py
├── dp/
│   └── fibonacci.py
└── arrays/
    └── sorting.py

Java/
├── LinkedLists/
│   └── ReverseList.java
└── Recursion/
    └── Factorial.java
```

### 📌 Directory Naming
- Language directories: Use any clear, standard name (e.g., Python, CPP, JavaScript, Rust)
- Topic directories: Use descriptive names that reflect the content (e.g., trees, sorting, graphs, strings)
- Feel free to create new topic directories as needed!tructures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions in multiple programming languages.  
If you're learning DSA or want to practice contributing to open source, this repo is for you.

## ✅ Rules

- One problem solution per pull request
- File naming: `problem_name.language_extension`
- Comment your code clearly
- The **problem name must be clearly mentioned** in the comments
- Avoid duplicate solutions in the same language
- New solutions for different languages are welcome
